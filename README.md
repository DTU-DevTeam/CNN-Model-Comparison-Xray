## üìñ Project Summary

[cite_start]This project, ‚ÄúResearch and Comparison of CNN Models (U-Net, YOLO) for Pathology Diagnosis via X-ray Imagery,‚Äù is a strategic Research and Development (R&D) initiative.  [cite_start]The primary goal is to identify the optimal technology platform for our company's future line of intelligent medical products. 

[cite_start]The final deliverable will be a data-driven technology recommendation and a functional prototype software. [cite: 8]

## üéØ Core Objective

[cite_start]The main objective is to complete the research, comparison, and selection of the optimal CNN model architecture between U-Net and YOLO (and their variants). [cite: 12] [cite_start]This will be done to build an effective prototype for diagnosing two common pathologies on chest X-rays: detecting pulmonary nodules and segmenting pneumonia. [cite: 12]

## üî¨ Methodology & Hypotheses

Our research is guided by two central hypotheses:

* [cite_start]**Hypothesis 1: YOLO for Rapid Screening**: We hypothesize that YOLO's architecture (e.g., YOLOv8) is best suited for the rapid detection of discrete objects like pulmonary nodules, prioritizing speed (FPS) and high mAP for mass screening applications. [cite: 18, 19, 20, 21]
* [cite_start]**Hypothesis 2: U-Net for Precise Analysis**: We hypothesize that U-Net's architecture (e.g., U-Net++) is superior for accurately segmenting diffuse conditions like pneumonia, where boundary accuracy (measured by Dice/IoU) is critical for assessing the extent of the disease. [cite: 22, 23, 24, 25]

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React (TypeScript + SWC)
* **Backend & Model Serving:** Python, Flask/FastAPI
* **AI/ML Models:** PyTorch/TensorFlow, U-Net++, YOLOv8
* **Deployment:** Docker, Google Vertex AI / AWS SageMaker
